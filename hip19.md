# Aeon Cryptosystems (Aeon Cryptosystems Co.)
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

This is Aeon Crytosystems application for manufacturing its first hotspot model. This hotspot will be heavy, but light and anchor hotspots are also in development. 
Aeon also aims to distribute these hotspots directly along with highly optimized antenna installations for maximum coverage for the network

## Company Information

Aeon Crytosystems is a new Helium focused startup which aims to develop the helium ecosystem by improving antenna installations, developing sensors for the agricultural industry, 
and distributing hotspots.

Aeom aims to help pioneer the democratization of cryptocurrency production, internet
technology, and all other technology that can bring power, independence, security, and prosperity to the people.

## Product Information

Our first product we are seeking approval for in this document is the Aeon Heavy
Aeon Heavy features:
 * Semtech SX1302 based
 * 27 dBm output power
 * powerful Raspberry Pi 4 
 * long life SD card for the transition period to light hotspots
 * Large fan, ducting, and heat sink for improved thermal performance over other Raspberry Pi based hotspots
 * ECC608 swarm_key storage
 * anti-tamper epoxy covering for ECC608
 * BLE onboarding
 * running official Helium firmware for fast updates
 * dedicated voltage regulation chip for LoRa board to prevent brownouts
 
A light hotspot and anchor hotspot are also currently in development


## Customer Support

Customer support will be handled with a dedicated technician call center trained on servicing our product, and we also have technians available on discord for community support. 

## Hardware Security

for the Aeon Heavy, the swarm_key is generated and stored on the ECC608. The ECC608 is covered in an encapsulation resin to prevent tampering. 
The ECC608 will be located on the mainboard, not the RF board for the Aeon Heavy. 

## Manufacturing Information

We are manufacturing with COTOCM, a contract manufacturer, located in Mexicali. 

## Proof of Identity

Submitted privately to DeWi.


## Budget & Capital

Volume for the first month is targeted at 5000 units, followed by 1000 units for subsequent months. 
Capital has already been secured for manufacturing, and proof of capital has been sent privately to DiWi. 

## Risks & Challenges

Our biggest challenges will be passing FCC intentional radiator certification in a timely manner. To overcome this challenge, we plan to contract our FCC certification to 
Sunfire Testing who should greatly expedite the process with their experience.
